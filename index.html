	<div id="synopsis">
		<p class="pullquote">It is 1898, and a series of brutal murders sends Reverier in chaos.</p>
		<p>The government declares a state of martial law. Military Police march the capital's streets in an attempt to keep the peace. Arrests and interrogations have been made&mdash;some highly questionable. All this is done to protect the people from the Creatures that have plagued them ever since. This time, however, a new rogue group has risen with the one desire to destroy humanity.</p>
		<p>Enter Lucas, journalist for <i>The Reverier Times</i> and unfortunate enough to find himself at the wrong place at a very wrong time. Together with fellow human, Catherine Hunter and the Spectre, Cipher, Lucas is forced to battle secret societies, uncover conspiracy theories and face the family he swore to forget in his ambitious quest for truth&mdash;whatever "truth" means.</p>
